<p>Well, if you've come here you should already know that my name is Steven Leigh, and I'm a programmer.</p>
<p>I finished my double degree in IT and Mathematics on the 21st of June 2008.</p>
<p>My main passion in programming is 3D Graphics and/or real time simulation. In recent months, I've been spending all day working at <a href="http://www.saucesoft.com">Sauce Software</a> as the lead web developer, and then coming home and spending 6hrs programming and learning about graphics before eventually dragging myself to bed.</p>
<p>I've worked as a web developer at Sauce for 18 months, 6 of those as the lead developer. Working at Sauce has allowed me to gain significant skills in managing projects and making decisions which affect the running of over 100 client companies. I've also defined some project processes that are now being used for new projects.</p>
<p>Most of my professional experience has been based in the web industry, though in 2005-2006, I worked for a year as an application developer for <a href="http://www.dialog.com.au">Dialog</a>, where I helped support, maintain and developer a HR Application called "AXiOM". This was a part of QUT's "Cooperative Education" program, and lasted 12 months.</p>
<p>While these professional jobs were very helpful and interesting, my main passion has been the programming I do at home in my spare time. These are available for perusal by clicking the links in the projects section on the right, under pages.</p>
