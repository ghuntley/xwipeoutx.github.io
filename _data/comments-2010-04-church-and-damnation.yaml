    Hi Steve,
    
    I think you've gotten the correct gist of what I meant by "oppressive culture". To clarify: I was referring to the church as an institution, rather than individual churches, or churches in general. I gather that individual churches have enough independence that they don't have to preach the 'party line', so to speak, and you're right that directly telling people "Stop doing X or you'll go to hell" would be counter-productive.
    
    Even without explicit threats however, you can still tell people how to think. If they don't think that way, then they must be 'sinning'. Sure, they could ask forgiveness, but they're still going to be left with the guilt that they've somehow wronged Christ (never mind whoever else they may have affected). And so they try not to think that way anymore. I would argue that the stick of immediate guilt is much stronger than the stick of distant, and abstract, hell, which can be avoided by asking for forgiveness anyway.
    
    There will also be an effect of peer pressure within an individual church which makes it difficult to speak out against authority. This is by no means unique to religion of course. Authority by its nature creates this kind of environment - more often than not, if you disagree with the authority, then you'll be wrong, right? They wouldn't be in charge if they were wrong, surely. The difference here between the church and say, the workplace, is that the church teaches morals, which you will use as the basis of your behaviour, while the workplace teaches how to properly fill out your TPS form, which has a much more shallow effect.
    
    How open to disagreement is a church? If your priest makes a point with a passage from the bible, do you feel able to question him about a contradicting passage? If he teaches a certain morality that you don't necessarily agree with, do you feel free to debate him? I'm not talking about you asking him a question, and him giving you an answer, but rather a proper rational debate.
    
    Oppression does not have to be in overt form, and this is why I used the phrase "oppressive culture". The teachings of a church can be purely positive, but still foster an oppressive culture, if the negative aspects are not openly discussed.
    
    I'm not really trying to refute your assertions here, I'll leave that sort of thing to your future evidence and rationality-based posts, where arguments on both sides can be more direct. I just thought I would attempt to give you a better idea of what I meant by "oppressive culture". Obviously it would have been difficult to fit all of this into 140 characters :).

    PS. I have actually been 'churched' somewhat while I was in school in England. We were taught that Christmas should always be spelled with a capital C, and never ever X-mas, because Christmas is about Christ. Of course no mention was made to its roots in paganism. Anyone who didn't agree with singing the weekly christian hymns, or reenacting the nativity play, was politely asked to leave for the rest of the assembly/class. Everything was kept positive of course, but free-thinking was hardly encouraged. This is just my brief experience of course, and I don't put too much weight into it. You can still count me as one of the unchurched.
