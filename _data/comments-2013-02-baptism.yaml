    Baptism at birth doesn't seem relevant, or necessary. I was baptised at birth and am a Christian, yet I know people who were also baptised at birth and are not. So I don't think baptism (at birth) alone saves anyone at all. It doesn't even sway their spiritual walk at all. I think the environment the child grows up in will help push them towards Christ, but He alone is the only one who can save the child. I think that's right? :S
    
    Should I bother being baptised again as an adult? Would it really make any difference if I have already been baptised? I don't see the point in repeating it. Besides, I am already saved.
    
    On a side note: [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:15-18&amp;version=NIV]() I think it is interesting that I have never seen those signs.
