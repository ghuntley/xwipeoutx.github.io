<p>A quick run down on what I've been working on since my last update of ages ago. My last project-related post was 3 years ago, when I was doing the 3D version of Zombies are Attacking My Fridge.</p>
<p>Since then, I've worked on the following the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>ZAMF2D: 2D version of ZAMF - <a href="http://stevesspace.com/my-projects/zamf-2d">http://stevesspace.com/my-projects/zamf-2d</a></li>
<li>jFluidic: Javascript version of Fluidic - jFluidic. <a href="http://stevesspace.com/projects/jfluidic/">http://stevesspace.com/projects/jfluidic/</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xwipeoutx/jFluidic">https://github.com/xwipeoutx/jFluidic</a></li>
<li>Basil: Javascript testing framework with Hierarchical test setup - <a href="https://github.com/xwipeoutx/basil">https://github.com/xwipeoutx/basil</a></li>
<li>Chalkboard Parkour: Entry to an XBox game programming competition - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjeR6GP4OiU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjeR6GP4OiU</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So I've been fairly busy, arguably not busy enough!</p>
<p>My priority at the moment is to finish Basil - it's in a workable enough state now, but the filtering needs work before it can be used in any reasonably large project (such as what we have at Zap).  I'm quite proud of Basil - I'm unaware of any other testing framework in any language that matches it in terms of readability of the test.  Hopefully it takes off in popularity when I'm finished with it and the documentation.</p>
