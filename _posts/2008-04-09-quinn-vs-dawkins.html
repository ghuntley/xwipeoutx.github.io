<p>FINALLY found someone who's not afraid to go on the offensive against Dawkins, and effectively. Quick summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dawkins constructs a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">straw-men</a></li>
<li>Dawkins evades questions on free will, saying it's not important - when it's tantamount to philosophy and morality</li>
<li>Dawkins mentions attrocities commited by religious, while saying that atrocities commited by athiests FOR atheism is irrelevant</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, I had a great laugh.</p>
