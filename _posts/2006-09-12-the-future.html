<p>From <i>The Message</i>:<br />
<blockquote>For if the future is dominated by the coming again of Jesus, there is little room left on the screen for projecting our anxieties and fantasies. It takes the clutter out of our lives.  We're far more free to respond spontaneously to the freedom of God</p></blockquote>
