<p>Yeah... stale start, as opposed to fresh start - because I'm not going to remove any of the previous posts, but I shall be writing again!</p>
<p>I found it hard to keep up with a blog that was almost entirely filled with Christian posts and apologetics.  If I hadn't had a particularly enthralling conversation or anything, it was very hard to write anything. And writing something when the last post is several months ago is quite difficult, so I basically stopped writing anything.</p>
<p>So I'm going to refocus and expand a little now.  I'll still have any religious tidbits I have to share coming along, but I imagine this will have a lot more programming adventures in it.</p>
<p>So keep tuned :) I'll be posting again shortly.</p>
