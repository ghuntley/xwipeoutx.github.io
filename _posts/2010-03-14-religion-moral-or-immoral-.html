<p>- More moral at the time of writings<br />
- Both inspire acts of both good and evil<br />
-- marxism - atheism rebranded<br />
- Religion provides a framework for commiting atrocious acts - which have been done in its name repeatedly<br />
- Relgion provides a framework for commiting self sacrificing loving acts - which have been done in its name repeatedly<br />
- Organised atheism as a fairly new phenomenon, compared with religion.</p>
