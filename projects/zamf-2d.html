<p><strong>NOTE: Development on ZAMF2D has ceased</strong></p>
<p>You are part of an elite team of zombie hunters, but you keep drawing the short straw and have to stay behind to guard your team's base & food supply when they go out on missions. Luckily you were Macguyver or an Engineer in a past life and know how to build some nifty things out of household items, but you need to also stock the fridge to feed your team when they get back from saving innocent people from zombie attacks nearby.</p>

<a href="http://stevesspace.com/projects/zamf2d/rel/latest.zip">Download Latest Version</a></p>
<p>Before each mission, your team sets up a base in a nearby house for you to defend. They sometimes build extra turrets or leave you with weapons in more hostile areas, but usually you have to fend for yourself.</p>
<p>At the end of each level, the amount of food you have in the fridge is counted up as points when your team returns.</p>
<p>ZAMF has a strong emphasis on user-submitted content, and as such, a user can modify every aspect of the game, and submit levels for other people to play on. Scores for the levels are submitted to an online leader board! You can compete against other people on your own levels!</p>
