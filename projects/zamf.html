<p><strong>NOTE: Development on ZAMF has ceased</strong></p>
<p>Zombies are Attacking My Fridge is a game that is inspired in part by the plethora of tower defense games made out there. A 3D real time tower defense game!</p>
<p>The idea is simple - there are zombies. They want to gain access to your fridge, and it's up to you to pull together household equipment to stop them. Swivel-chair mounted nailguns, doormats with spikes and deoderant-powered flame throwers all make up part of your arsenal as you defend the fridge against the vicious onslaught of Zombies.</p>
