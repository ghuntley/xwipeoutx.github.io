<p>
In Semester 1, 2008 I completed a Real-Time 3D Fluid simulation, which solves the Navier-Stokes equations in real time. The project was implemented in C++, OpenGL and Cg. It simulates the fluid or gas entirely on the GPU, which is fast enough to be used inside a game.</p>
<p>
On the right are a few videos showcasing the end results of this simulation. It could be inserted as a node in a scene graph quite easily, with minimal recoding required.</p>
<p>
The smoke is rendered using a simple raycasting technique. It will only perform the raycast on visible portions of the fluid volume, and the fluid blends in appropriately with its surroundings.</p>
<p>
Small steps have been made in making in react to light properly, though this is currently limited to a directional light.</p>
